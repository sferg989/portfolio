        My career journey as a <Highlight>Full Stack Developer</Highlight> and <Highlight>Tech Lead</Highlight> has been anything but traditional, shaping my ability to solve complex problems and adapt to diverse challenges. I hold a Master's in Music Performance and an MBA in Finance. I began my career in the finance department of a large aerospace and defense company, where I first started programmingâ€”writing <Highlight>PHP</Highlight> to automate tasks and eliminate wasted time. Next, I managed a 4,000-acre rice farm for four years. After that, I fully transitioned into technology, specializing in <Highlight>Next.js, React, TypeScript, Laravel, and WordPress development</Highlight>, working my way up to <Highlight>Tech Lead in Software Engineering</Highlight>. This unique path has honed my leadership, strategic thinking, and technical expertise in <Highlight>DevOps, CI/CD, and team management</Highlight>.
