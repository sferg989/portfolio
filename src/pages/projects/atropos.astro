            <h3>Learning from nature</h3>

            <p>
                Atropos, in Greek mythology one of the three Moirai, is the name
                of the research project born at +LAB, Politecnico di Milano,
                where CFM technology - Continuous Fiber Manufacturing - was
                developed. This became the foundation of <a
                    href="https://www.moi.am"
                    target="_blank">Moi Composites</a
                >.
            </p>

            <p>
                Inspired by nature and silkworms, and controlled by the
                artificial intelligence of special algorithms, Atropos fluently
                moves in space depositing a continuous fiber of thermosetting
                composite material, instantly cured as it comes out of his head.
            </p>

            <p>
                A new era of manufacturing has born, combining the quality of
                custom-made product with the performance of technological
                artisanship.

            <p>
                To accommodate a variety of applications, from biomedical to
                aerospace, a material library was developed. This is based on a
                modular system where is possible to mix and match different
                resins with various fibers, achieving a composite material with
                the desired performance.

            <p>
                To quickly iterate and improve the code for path planning and
                the robotic simulation of CFM technology, a set of more than 30
                Grasshopper components was developed, combining RhinoCommon API
                calls with custom algorithms. After testing, these components
                were included into the suite of CAD and CAM software. Strato
                powers the slicing and robotic control of all the systems, while
                Hi-Design is a web-based CAD software for dental prostheses.

                Sistema, Italian for System, is the robotic platform that
                enables the creation of composite parts through digital

                that can be scaled down to bite-sized dimensions or up to print
                boats. It can be equipped with various heads, capable of
                depositing a range of materials, from short fiber-reinforced
                resins to continuous fibers, also including finishing tools.
