            <h3>Guided Growth & Impact</h3>

            <p>
                One of my proudest mentoring achievements was guiding a recent hire through the creation of a shared utilities library. This project consolidated reusable functions duplicated across dozens of projects while providing comprehensive learning opportunities.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Mentoring Approach:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hands-on Exposure</strong> - Broad codebase experience from legacy to modern apps</li>
                <li><strong>Weekly 1:1s</strong> - Consistent coaching and guidance</li>
                <li><strong>Real Problem Solving</strong> - Technical challenges with business impact</li>
                <li><strong>Integration & Deployment</strong> - End-to-end project ownership</li>
                <li><strong>Confidence Building</strong> - From onboarding to key contributor</li>
                <li><strong>Ownership Development</strong> - Identifying refactoring opportunities independently</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This mentoring approach helped the engineer grow from a new hire to a confident contributor who could identify and execute improvement opportunities across multiple applications.

            </p>
            <ul>
