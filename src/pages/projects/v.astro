            <h3>Taking full control</h3>

            <p>
                Advances in software such as Rhino and Grasshopper in the
                mid-2010s allowed designers to experiment with new ways of
                generating 3D printer toolpaths that had previously only been
                generated by software such as Cura or Slic3r. The ability to
                completely control the position, flow ratio and speed in
                three-dimensional space, as well as a coherent printing
                sequence, allows the production of high-strength parts that take
                full advantage of the full range of material capabilities of FDM
                and LDM.
            </p>

            <p>
                Modifications to the geometry composing the object, such as
                infills, perimeters, and closing surfaces, significantly affect
                the mechanical behavior, and the combination of different
                geometries and materials opens up many new possibilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have designed a new three-dimensional adaptive infill that
                reduces the weight of the object while maintaining the span
                between the supports for the top and bottom surfaces. The object
                has also shown an elastic response that can be tuned by
                controlling the geometric parameters.

            <h3>A unique necklace</h3>

            <p>
                To demonstrate the application in a practical environment, I
                designed a necklace based on the ruled surface principle. This
                principle allows curved geometries to be described using
                straight lines. In this case, a series of lines are printed
                without supports, in three-dimensional space, connecting two
                sides of a square and writing a V, hence the name of the
                project.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to have a unique element without the need to connect
                the chain, the necklace is printed in sequence. First, the base
                is realized, leaving space for the chain that will be
                subsequently positioned by a human. Molten plastic is poured by
                the 3D printer onto the chain to solidify the connection, and
                then the rest of the ruled geometry is completed on top.
