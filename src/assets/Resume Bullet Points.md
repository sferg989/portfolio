- Conducts quarterly employee reviews.  Highlights from the quarter, and what needs to be improved.  Gives employee opportunity to discuss career goals, and 

#### Mentoring \- 

- *What was a time you coached or mentored someone you're proud of? Thank you in advance for taking the time to answer.* \*  
  - One example I'm proud of is mentoring a recent hire by guiding him through the creation of a shared utilities library. The goal was to consolidate and replace simple, reusable functions that were duplicated across dozens of our projects.  
    This initiative not only solved a technical problem, but also gave him hands-on exposure to a broad range of our codebases—from a legacy Create React App to our most modern Next.js 15 applications.  
    Through consistent weekly 1:1s, I coached him through the entire process, including integration and deployment across multiple properties. Over time, that exposure helped him build confidence, take ownership of several applications, and eventually start identifying refactoring opportunities on his own. It was rewarding to see his growth from onboarding to being a key contributor.

#### Interest in role \- 

- *We'd love to hear a little about your interest in this role, including if you have experience in renewable energy/startups/or both. \**

In my most recent role at Delta Defense, I was part of a fast-growing, subscription-based digital marketing company. During my time there, we grew revenue from $65 million in 2018 to over $300 million by 2024—more than 4.5x growth in six years. It was a high-growth, startup-like environment, which I really thrived in.

What excites me most about this role is the 50/50 split between engineering and people leadership. I love staying close to the code—whether that’s architecting systems or building tools—but I also find mentoring engineers and helping teams scale to be deeply rewarding.

I’m also drawn to your emphasis on bias for action over bias for any particular tech stack. Over the past 15 years, I’ve worked across PHP, React (12 years), TypeScript, Node, and a wide range of frontend frameworks and libraries. I enjoy the pace of change in frontend development and the opportunity to keep learning.

#### Conflict Resolution \- 

- Being Vulnerable with people.  Be willing to share what you think.    
- The most difficult problems are always people problems.    
- SEEK to understand.  My favorite.  Is “*Help me understand…”*   
- *Conflict with Colleagues, direct reports, and supervisors.*  

#### Examples

- *Continual Merge request problems* : I thought i communicated something vs what the engineer actually heard.  really it came back to lack of clear expectations.  And Communication.    
  - Moon Shot communication \- when we went to the moon.,  the GOV’t was all about selling it to the people.  Everyone knew what we were trying to do.  Imagine, if the USA did it, aired the video and they did not tell anyone they were doing it.  Just imagine the public outrage.  We as leaders need to get everyone onboard and be an advocate for the direction of the task or vision.    
  - *People have to hear something 7 times, before everyone hears it.*    
  - *I WIll continue to remind you of these things.  Beat the same drum.*    
- ***Disagreement with another manager*** about how to use AI.  He believed all use of AI in code should be documented.  I completely disagreed.  It was very important that we met until we gained consensus.  Both parties need to come to the issue with a *Help me Understand Attitude.*

*What’s one consumer-facing web product you’ve built end-to-end or played a major role in? What did you own, and what impact did it have on users?*

One consumer-facing web product I led end-to-end was an online learning academy—a training platform that allowed users to stream individual videos or take structured courses behind a tiered membership paywall. It was built using Next.js and TypeScript, deployed on Cloudflare.

As the tech lead, I owned the full architecture and technical direction of the platform. I broke down the product vision into actionable engineering tasks, created the roadmap, and led a team of engineers through execution. At the same time, I was hands-on in the development process, building core features like state management, authentication, gated content delivery, and API interactions.

I also implemented development best practices like enforcing minimum 80% unit test coverage and coordinated with QA to build out a comprehensive automated testing suite.

The impact on users was immediate and measurable: the platform supported thousands of daily users, and created a seamless user experience that encouraged higher engagement and subscription upgrades. It became a key revenue driver for the business and was the foundation for future educational product launches.

#### Learning & development

*Continue/Stop/Start" conversations and openness to upward feedback.*

- IDP \- having SMART goals.  About specific tech the individual wants to learn.  Subscribing to things like frontendmasters.com   
- Conducting regular 1:1 giving the employee the opportunity to hear regular feedback from me, and for me ot hear regular feedback.  Also, encouraging skip levels.  
- DX survey also is a good information to how the manager is doing or how the Eng team is doing as a whole.    
  - A DX survey gives data points of how we are actually doing, and what the ENG teams wants to work on.    
  - A great example of this is local dev workflow.  Or CI/CD pipelines.  If the platform team can do something that will remove burden from the client team.  Lets make a request, and get it on the roadmap.  Or atleast.  Give opportunity to 

#### Communication & collaboration styles

- DISC \- profile. I am a DI,   
- “We make architecture decisions as a team”.    
- Be intentional about the Tech decision we make.  Tools are tools.  Not the law.
